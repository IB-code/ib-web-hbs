        <p>There's a mismatch of supply & demand in the Birmingham Tech Scene. We have more jobs to fill that we have qualified
            and trained applicants. This is where Innovate Birmingham comes in. We are a grant-funded </p>

        <h2 class="pb-4">The History</h2>
        <p class=" text-center ">In 2017, Birmingham was awarded Obama's America's Promise Grant for ~$6 million dollars from the U.S. Department of Labor to equip underserved youth in the Greater Birmingham region with resources they need to advance into Information Technology (IT) jobs.  Out of this grew the Innovate Birmingham Workforce Department, which provides education in software development and IT help desk support, as well as offers scholarships to UAB, Jeff State, and Lawson state. The goal of our program is to provide opportunity, free of charge, and create a pipeline between talented people and employers in Birmingham. Weâ€™ve already had students hired at companies like BBVA Compass, UAB, Shipt, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Evaluating the Tech Ecosystem</h2>
        <p class="text-center">Along with Innovate Birmingham Workforce there was another branch of Innovate Birmingham, or as a we loving referred to it "Big Innovate", that was responsible for evaluating and researching the tech ecosystem in Birmingham. Throughout their year and a half long tenure, Big Innovate produced a number of reports, which reveal the gaps and issues found in the Birmingham tech scene. These reports can be found here.</p>
