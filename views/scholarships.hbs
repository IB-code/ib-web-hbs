                        <p>Being awarded the "Innovate Birmingham Scholarship" through Innovate Birmingham helped with my
                            financial obligations and allowed my career to take off with the opportunities it provided. I was a
                            Computer Science major at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. I had an internship last summer
                            at Cofense as a Threat Analyst. The company kept me part-time in my fall semester of senior year.
                            After completing my internship, they promoted me to full-time employment.</p>

                        <p>Innovate Birmingham has really helped me and my family. With losing my parents at 10 years old, I
                            gave up hope of my life going as I wanted to be successful. I was blessed to be connected with the
                            great resources that I have received from Innovate Birmingham. I feel like I am capable of success
                            and can provide numerous opportunities for my children. I will forever be grateful.</p>
