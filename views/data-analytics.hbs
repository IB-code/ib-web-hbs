        <h3 class="mb-5">Using Data to Answer the Why</h3>
        <p>Data Analysis isn't just about math and statistics and nice looking graphs and charts. At the heart of Data
            Analysis is the question of Why? With tons of data
            occupying servers around the world, being able to make sense of it all to make informed decisions isn't a
            choice anymore. It's a necessity.
            Learning how to
            visualize, cleanse, interpet, and interact with data through tools like Power BI, Tableau, Access, and
            Excel is a key step to translating all those 1s and 0s into valuable business decisions.</p>
