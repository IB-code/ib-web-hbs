                Recognizing that participants may require supportive services to achieve success during training and
                throughout the
                transition into employment, Innovate Birmingham has a full-time Senior Case Manager who provides
                holistic case
                management. At the start of the program, participants complete an intake assessment to identify
                potential barriers. Our
                Senior Case Manager works with each student to develop a Student Directed Learning Plan (SDLP) to
                address these
                barriers.

                        <p>"Innovate Birmingham (IB) has had a transformative impact on my life. My wife and I found
                            out we were having our
                            firstborn the Saturday before I started the program in January 2019. With the skills gained
                            from the instructor in the
                            Software Development program at that time, and the valuable personal development, including
                            things like resume building
                            and interview preparation from Carlton Lewis, I was able to find employment and entered the
                            tech space the
                            Monday following graduation. IB allowed me the abilities to find a career in a field I
                            enjoy,
                            and for my wife and I to
                            start a family without worry. IB’s program is full-time (Monday-Friday) with additional time
                            spent learning in the
                            evenings and on weekends. The supportive services of IB were a key factor in what allowed me
                            to finish the program. With
                            the help of Brandie McGee-McMillian, the Senior Case Manager of Supportive Services, I was
                            able to get assistance
                            with housing costs while in the program, which allowed me to focus more on my training and
                            skill development"</p>

                        <p>"Innovate Birmingham positively impacted my life in that it allowed
                            me the opportunity to learn
                            how to become a Web Developer. Acquiring these skills was significant to me because my late
                            brother, who was a Senior
                            Level Developer, was very excited about the field and expressed often how well he thought
                            I’d do if I got into it too.
                            The 14-week, full-time coding bootcamp was intense and coupled with grieving it was really
                            tough, but Supportive Services
                            helped take some of the edge off to allow me to focus on my class work. The financial
                            assistance I received from
                            Supportive Services for my utilities and rent was major in that they helped me keep from
                            worrying about how certain
                            expenses would be covered during my time in the bootcamp. Additionally, being able to check
                            in periodically with Brandie
                            to talk about how things were going was equally as valuable as she understood what I was
                            going through. I don’t believe I
                            could have made it through the bootcamp without the financial and emotional support provided
                            by Supportive Services. I’m
                            eternally grateful for this program."</p>
